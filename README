MixiPOP3 v. 1.000
By Jawaad Mahmood

Requests / Bugfixes: mixipop3@ordisante.com
-------------------------------------------

MixiPOP3 is an attempt to make the Mixi Social Networking System
available over POP3 for users with unreliable connections.

The overreaching objective is *to make it easier to make real-life friends
through Mixi*.

A secondary objective is to learn a bit about the use cases for PHP5.3's
namespaces and improve on them as well.

This project makes use of the excellent SimpleHTMLDOM library produced by
S.C. Chen, Jose Solorzano et al.

My own code for this project is under the GPL3.

Navi, in the context of this document, refers to the mailbot who handles
requests by mail.

version is based on the star Alpha Centauri (So close - yet so far away)
